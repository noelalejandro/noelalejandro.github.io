#### [Rhodonea.amxd](https://github.com/noelalejandro/Max/blob/main/Rhodonea.amxd) is an audio-reactive visualizer in the form of a Max for Live device, deisgned and programmed for use in Ableton Live Suite. Drawing upon the legacy of Italian mathematician Guido Grandi (1671-1742), Rhodonea.amxd generates "rose" polar coordinate graphs, of which the user has control over:
- RGBA values
- rotation
- zoom
- point size
- smoothing
- frequency

In its current form, Rhodonea.amxd automatically takes an audio signal input to modulate RGB values. In later Iterations, I hope to implement an auto/manual function for more user interactivity and control of the overall color. This device is a derivative of code by [Umut Eldem](https://github.com/umutreldem/hearing-glass/tree/main/tutorials), licensed under GNU General Public LIcense v3 (GPL 3.0).
