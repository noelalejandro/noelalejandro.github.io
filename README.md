#### [Rhodonea.amxd](https://github.com/noelalejandro/Max/blob/main/Rhodonea.amxd) is an audio-reactive visualizer in the form of a Max for Live device, deisgned and programmed for use in Ableton Live Suite. Drawing upon the legacy of Italian mathematician Guido Grandi (1671-1742), Rhodonea.amxd generates "rose" polar coordinate graphs, of which the user has control over:
- RGBA Values
- Rotation
- Zoom
- Point Size
- Smoothing
- Frequency

#### In its current form, Rhodonea.amxd automatically takes an audio signal input to modulate RGB values. In later Iterations, I hope to implement an auto/manual toggle for complete control over color output. This device is a derivative of code by [Umut Eldem](https://github.com/umutreldem/hearing-glass/tree/main/tutorials), licensed under GNU General Public LIcense v3 (GPL 3.0).

## Design Process
#### Learn
Having never programmed anything in Max, I spent hours reading over bits of the Max 8 documentation. Cycling '74 has done an amazing job with their documentation by providing extensive tutorials and guides on Max, MSP, and Jitter. The Max community forum also offers great support and feedback on projects. YouTube tutorials were also instrumental in figuring out what was going on inside the world of Max. Since this project is of an audio-visual nature, much of my time was spent learning how Jitter operates. 
#### Refine
What intriguiged me most, at first, were abstract visuals. As the project progressed I began to 
#### Iterate
fine tuning, deeper exploration of possible parameter control
#### Package
clean up, “Max for Live Best Practices” tutorial, presentation
#### Beta Test
sent device to four colleagues for feedback
